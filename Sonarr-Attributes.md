Configuring [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) is optional but will allow you to send shows to a Sonarr instance when they're found missing while updating a library's collections.

Sonarr V2 may work, but it is not supported please upgrade to V3 if you can.

A `sonarr` mapping can be either in the root of the config file as global mapping for all libraries or you can specify the `sonarr` mapping individually per library.

Below is a `sonarr` mapping example and the full set of attributes:
```YAML
sonarr:
  url: http://192.168.1.12:32789
  token: ################################
  add: true
  root_folder_path: S:/Shows
  monitor: all
  quality_profile: HD-1080p
  language_profile: English
  series_type: standard
  season_folder: true
  tag: pmm
  search: false
  cutoff_search: false
  sonarr_path: /media
  plex_path: /share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/Multimedia
```

* The `token` can be found by going to `Sonarr > Settings > General > Security > API Key`

* The `quality_profile` and `language_profile` must be the exact name of the desired quality profile, including all spaces and capitalization.

* You can set most attributes per collection by using the [Sonarr Collection Detail](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/wiki/Collection-Details#sonarr-attributes)
